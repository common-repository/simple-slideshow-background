Display a full size slideshow in the background featuring images from the media library.

== Description ==

Slideshow background adds a full size, smooth transition slideshow to the background of a Wordpress site. Images can be selected from the media library or uploaded via drag-and-drop. Every page load will begin at a random position in the image loop so that users are not presented with the same start image every page change.

Additionally, the images maintain their aspects ratios during resize and turn off for mobile users.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use existing photos in my media library? =

Yes. It is not recommended to select the largest format. Generally the second largest is a reasonable balance between load time and picture quality.
